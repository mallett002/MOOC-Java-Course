The common raven (Corvus corax), also known as the northern raven, is a large all-black passerine bird.
Found across the Northern Hemisphere, it is the most widely distributed of all corvids.
There are at least eight subspecies with little variation in appearance, although recent research has demonstrated
significant genetic differences among populations from various regions. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside
the thick-billed raven, and is possibly the heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the common raven averages 63
centimetres (25 inches) in length and 1.2 kilograms (2.6 pounds) in mass. Common ravens can live up to 21 years in the
wild,[2] a lifespan surpassed among passerines by only a few Australasian species such as the satin bowerbird[3] and
probably the lyrebirds. Young birds may travel in flocks but later mate for life, with each mated pair defending a
territory.

Common ravens have coexisted with humans for thousands of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people
have regarded them as pests. Part of their success as a species is due to their omnivorous diet; they are extremely
versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit,
small animals, nesting birds, and food waste.

Some notable feats of problem-solving provide evidence that the common raven is unusually intelligent.[4] Over the
centuries, it has been the subject of mythology, folklore, art, and literature. In many cultures, including the
indigenous cultures of Scandinavia, ancient Ireland and Wales, Bhutan, the northwest coast of North America, and
Siberia and northeast Asia, the common raven has been revered as a spiritual figure or godlike creature.
